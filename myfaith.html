    <p class="sponsortext">Union Gospel Mission provides a sponsorship program so that all the students who attend the Pritchard campus can attend <br>
      without having to pay a tuition fee. This support also extends to students who attend other grades at the Matheson and Jefferson campuses.<br>
    
    UGM provides support for up to 100 students. Both school and UGM staff members maintain regular supportive contact with the <br>families of sponsored students.<br><br>
    
    
    
    Sponsorship can be done through <a  href="#">UGM’s Adopt-a-Student program.</a><br><br>
    
    
    
    You can also make donations to Faith Academy by dropping a cheque off to the office or through  <a href="#">Canada Helps.</a><br><br>
    
    
    
    Faith Academy is a registered charity ministering in the North End of the city of Winnipeg.  We believe that no student should ever be <br>
    refused acceptance to the school because of a lack of money.  Accordingly, we provide assistance in the form of reduced fees where<br> 
    possible.  While the Lord sees these needs, if you are willing to help we certainly appreciate any size of donation.</p><br><br>

      <h1 class="mission">MISSIONS TEAMS</h1>
      <p class="text">The mission teams each have a trip that they prepare for, but their primary focus is discipleship and spiritual growth within the school<br> throughout the year.<br>
    
    
    
    The Mission 2 team is made up of Grade 12 students. Each Mission 2 team member is expected to take a leadership role throughout <br>the school and specifically focus on a group of students whom they encourage and disciple. To be chosen for a mission team, students<br> must apply and have a willingness to serve in this capacity, and have a growing relationship with Christ. A staff member takes<br> responsibility to pray for, encourage and mentor the team members and holds them accountable for discipling other students. The team<br> members also have an opportunity to participate in an international trip. In the past, the missions teams have gone to places such as <br>eastern Europe and Central America. To participate in this trip, each member must be able to raise finances, get their passport and<br> visa, receive parental permission and commit the time to go. They have opportunities to get involved in a variety of fundraising efforts <br>such as the Quiz Night, Pancake Breakfast, Cafés and coupon book sales to help raise money for their trip.<br><br>
    
    
    The Mission 1 team is made up of students from Grade 10 through 12 and works with Pathway Ministries. They travel to Fairford,<br> Manitoba during Spring Break to run a day camp for local children. The team meets for a monthly outing to serve in the local<br> community at places such as Union Gospel Mission and Agape Table. They also participate in an urban plunge in the North End<br> and go on a 2-day winter retreat.<br><br></p>

      <h1 class="trips"> SCHOOL TRIPS</h1>
<div class="schoolcont">
   <p class="schooltext">Each year students go on field trips to enhance their learning experiences. These trips often include trips to the Manitoba Museum, <br>
   Festival du Voyageur, Fort Whyte Centre, Harbourview and various activities according to lessons learned in the curriculum or<br>
    opportunities for extra sports events. These trips occur during school hours and bussing is provided for students to and from the activity.<br> A small fee is often charged to cover some costs and a parent permission form will be sent home and must be returned in order<br>
     for students to leave the campus to participate.<br><br>
   
   
   
   In some years there are also extra events planned which may include extended day or overnight retreats.<br><br>
   
   
   
   <p class="grade">Grade 8 Retreat—Middle School Jefferson</p>
   
   
   
   At the beginning of October, students spend two days at Red Rock Bible Camp for a Grade 8 retreat. They participate in fun outdoor <br>activities and learn about having a friendship with God. It is a great chance for students to spend time together and be challenged in <br>their faith as they start their final year at the Middle School.<br><br>
   
   
   
   <p class="grade">Grade 10 Retreat</p>
   
   
   
   Each year the Grade 10 class enjoys a full day in Gimli, Manitoba for a time of building community looking ahead or reflecting on <br>each student’s identity, and faith. It also includes swimming, games and lunch together.<br><br>
   
   
   
   <p class="grade">Grade 11 Ottawa Trip</p>
   
   
   
   Every year the Grade 11 class travels to Ottawa, our nation’s capital city. The students visit many historical locations such as the<br> Parliament buildings, the Museum of Civilization, the National Art Gallery, Upper Canada Village and many more. Although the trip is<br> heavily subsidized by the school, there are still costs borne by the students. Fees to cover the cost of entrance, transportation around the<br> city, lodging and meals while in Ottawa are required before students are permitted to go. The students will be offered the opportunity to <br>sell chocolates to raise money.<br><br>
   
   
   
   <p class="grade">Grade 12 Retreats  Roseau River, fall retreat and Camp Arnes, winter retreat</p>
   Every year the Grade 12 class travels to Roseau River Bible Camp for a chance to experience the outdoors. Very few experiences<br> provide the opportunity for personal growth and friendships to develop, like this retreat. Roseau River Bible Camp is a Christian<br> community; all campers and staff are encouraged to encounter God in the midst of creation. Some of the activities are canoeing,<br> swimming and hiking, with some good old fashioned bonding by the fire.<br><br>
   
   Camp Arnes is located on the shores ded forest and meadows. <br>This retreat setting is a great and effective way to provide godliness in the students while experiencing God’s creation. This winter retreat<br> is an amazing experience that they won’t forget. Sleeping in cabins, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, skating, and indoor activities<br> like ping-pong are some highlights.<br><br>
